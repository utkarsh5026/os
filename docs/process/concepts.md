  - Scheduling criteria (CPU utilization, throughput, turnaround time, waiting time, response time).
  - Types of schedulers (long-term, short-term, medium-term).
  - Scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, RR, Priority, Multilevel Queue, Multilevel Feedback Queue).
- **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)** 💬

  - Mechanisms of IPC (pipes, message queues, shared memory, semaphores, sockets).

  - Many-to-Many Model.
- **Thread Lifecycle** 🧵

  - States of a thread (New, Runnable, Running, Waiting, Terminated).
  - Transitions between states.
  - Thread creation and termination.
- **Thread Libraries** 📚

  - POSIX Pthreads.
  - Windows threads.
  - Java threads.
- **Thread Synchronization** 🔐
