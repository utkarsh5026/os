   - **Advantages**: Simple to implement.
   - **Disadvantages**: Can lead to long waiting times (convoy effect).
   - **Example**:
     ```plaintext
     Process Arrival Time Burst Time
     P1       0           4
     P2       1           3

   - **Mechanism**: The process with the shortest burst time is selected next.
   - **Advantages**: Minimizes average waiting time.
   - **Disadvantages**: Difficult to predict burst time accurately.
   - **Example**:
     ```plaintext
     Process Arrival Time Burst Time
     P1       0           6
     P2       1           2
     P3       2           8
     ```

   - **Mechanism**: Saving the state of the current process and restoring the state of the next process.
   - **Overhead**: Context switching has an associated overhead due to saving and loading process states.
3. **Starvation and Aging** ‚öñÔ∏è

   - **Starvation**: Occurs when low-priority processes wait indefinitely.
   - **Aging**: Technique to gradually increase the priority of waiting processes to prevent starvation.
4. **Throughput, Turnaround Time, Waiting Time, and Response Time** ‚è±Ô∏è

   - **Throughput**: Number of processes completed per time unit.
   - **Turnaround Time**: Total time taken from process submission to completion.
   - **Waiting Time**: Total time a process spends in the ready queue.
   - **Response Time**: Time from process submission to the first response.

---

#### Practical Example

Consider a system with three processes with the following properties:

```plaintext
Process Arrival Time Burst Time Priority
P1       0           5          3
P2       2           2          1
P3       4           1          2
```

**FCFS Scheduling**:

- **Gantt Chart**: `P1 [0-5] -> P2 [5-7] -> P3 [7-8]`
- **Average Waiting Time**: (0 + 3 + 3) / 3 = 2

**SJF Scheduling**:

- **Gantt Chart**: `P2 [0-2] -> P3 [2-3] -> P1 [3-8]`
- **Average Waiting Time**: (3 + 0 + 1) / 3 = 1.33

**Priority Scheduling**:

- **Gantt Chart**: `P2 [0-2] -> P3 [2-3] -> P1 [3-8]`
- **Average Waiting Time**: (3 + 0 + 1) / 3 = 1.33

**Round Robin (Quantum = 2)**:

- **Gantt Chart**: `P1 [0-2] -> P2 [2-4] -> P1 [4-6] -> P3 [6-7] -> P1 [7-8]`
- **Average Waiting Time**: (4 + 0 + 2) / 3 = 2

By comparing these algorithms, you can see how different scheduling strategies affect waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU utilization.
